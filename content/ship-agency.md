## For Agents acting as Port agents for Tramp operations, complex calculation of tariffs and its combinations make the difference between securing the business or losing it

eBMS Tramp agency solution enables agencies to quickly estimate and make Port Disbursement Accounts (DAs) and send quotations to principals. The sample DA is then updated until the end of the voyage to capture actual costs and remittances. Hours of coordination and reporting can be completed in minutes. The solution encompasses documentation, operations update and tracking with IGM EDI integration.
